# OPTRIS PI 450i


This code allows to easily access ravi files produced by Optris PI45Oi thermal imager. This code uses dLib C++ neural network to identify face landmarks in the images. Red language libraries for image processing are included. 


### Required 

First of all [Red Language](https://www.red-lang.org) is required. 

[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) is used to split ravi files as raw images.

We also use some python stuff
You need a recent C++ compiler. If not, install [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [cMake](https://cmake.org).

Install [Python 3] (https://www.python.org/downloads/ â€º download). Then with pip (or pip3) install numpy, cmake for python.
Finally install [dLibC++](http://dlib.net) dLib C++ with pip (pip install lib).
Once all that stuff installed, adapt path access to your compiuter and compile the source bbCry44.red with Red Tool Chain.

### Runnning the code

Code must be used in terminal mode. So, change dir to the code directory and execute ./bbCry44.

### Support

This program is supported by the [Agence Nationale de la Recherche](https://anr.fr) : ANR-19 - CE28-0014-03.
